# BookPlayer
Quickly made audio book player mobile app for Android. It uses [BaseFlow/XamarinMediaManager](https://github.com/Baseflow/XamarinMediaManager) under the hood and adds simple UI for the playing files and showing library content. 

I have no plans to develop this further, but maybe this can be useful draft project for someone to see how XamarinMediaManager can be easily used.

## Features
- Made with .NET (Visual Studio, Xamarin.Forms)
- Android app is functional. Also iOS project draft exists
- Two main views: player and "bookshelf". In addition there's simple settings page to specify book library folder path
- Light/dark theme
- Lock screen and quick access media playing controls provided by XamarinMediaManager
- Currently parses only books with its metadata in [SMIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronized_Multimedia_Integration_Language) format
